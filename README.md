## ReadMe for LIME Analysis on Medical Imaging Datasets

### Overview
This document provides an overview of the application of Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) on three medical imaging datasets: **CT Kidney**, **Pulmonary Chest X-ray**, and **Brain Tumor**. The goal is to generate heatmaps that visually represent the model's focus areas during predictions, aiding in the interpretability of deep learning models in medical contexts.

### Datasets
1. **CT Kidney**
   - Description: This dataset includes CT scans of kidneys, focusing on identifying various kidney diseases.
   - Size: [12,466]
   - Source: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nazmul0087/ct-kidney-dataset-normal-cyst-tumor-and-stone]

2. **Pulmonary Chest X-ray**
   - Description: This dataset consists of chest X-ray images aimed at diagnosing pulmonary conditions, including pneumonia and tuberculosis.
   - Size: [662]
   - Source: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/pulmonary-chest-xray-abnormalities]

3. **Brain Tumor**
   - Description: This dataset contains MRI scans for detecting brain tumors, classified into various types.
   - Size: [4600]
   - Source: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/preetviradiya/brian-tumor-dataset]

### Methodology
- **Model Training**: Each dataset was processed and used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model suitable for image classification tasks.
- **LIME Application**:
  - LIME was employed to generate explanations for model predictions by creating heatmaps that highlight the most influential regions in the images.
  - The process involves:
    - Identifying superpixels within the images.
    - Perturbing these superpixels to observe changes in model output.
    - Generating heatmaps based on the importance of each superpixel to the final prediction.

### Results
- **Heatmaps**: The generated heatmaps indicate which areas of the images were most significant for the model's predictions. 
- **Interpretation**: These visualizations help in understanding how the model interprets different features within the medical images, providing insights into potential diagnostic reasoning.

### Example Outputs
- Include visual examples of heatmaps generated from each dataset, showing areas of high importance marked distinctly (e.g., in red).

### Conclusion
The use of LIME in analyzing medical imaging data enhances interpretability, allowing clinicians and researchers to understand model behavior better and potentially improving trust in automated diagnostic systems.

### Future Work
- Explore other complex medical dataset and evaluate LIME Image explainer performance.
- Investigate the integration of domain knowledge to enhance model performance and explanation quality.

### References
- Include relevant academic references and citations related to LIME and its application in medical imaging.

This ReadMe serves as a guide for understanding the implementation and results of using LIME on these medical datasets, facilitating further research and development in explainable AI for healthcare applications.
